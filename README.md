# Practice-Java-Sem3

## Project Overview

The **Practice-Java-Sem3** repository contains solutions to a series of basic Java practice problems, organized by week. These problems were completed as part of the 3rd semester of the Software Development program at Keyin College. The repository serves as a demonstration of my growing skills in Java programming, focusing on topics such as algorithms, object-oriented programming, and data structures.

## Key Features

- **Organized by Week**: Problems are grouped based on the week they were completed in the semester.
- **Java Basics**: Solutions to problems focusing on fundamental Java concepts.
- **Problem-solving**: Each problem is designed to improve logic-building and algorithmic thinking in Java.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Practice-Java-Sem3.git
   cd Practice-Java-Sem3
   ```

2. **Navigate Through the Weeks**: 
   - Each week contains a folder with Java code for that week's problems.
   - Example: `Week1/`, `Week2/`, etc.

3. **Run the Java Programs**: 
   - Navigate to the folder containing the solution you want to run.
   - Use the following command to compile and run a Java program:
     ```bash
     javac <filename>.java
     java <classname>
     ```

## Testing

No specific testing framework has been applied, but each problem's solution can be manually tested by running the Java program and verifying its output.
